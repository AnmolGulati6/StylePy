# StylePy: Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

Explore the artistic blending of images with StylePy, a Python library built on PyTorch that implements cutting-edge neural style transfer algorithms. Perfect for developers, researchers, and artists interested in image processing and artificial intelligence.

## Features

- **Advanced Style Transfer Capabilities**: Perform style transfer using deep neural networks.
- **Flexible API**: Intuitive functions and classes that can be easily integrated or extended in your projects.
- **High-Level Customization**: Tailor the style transfer process to meet specific artistic needs.

## Installation

To get started with StylePy, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnmolGulati6/StylePy.git
cd StylePy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and PyTorch 1.8+ installed.

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to perform style transfer:

```python
import torch
from stylepy import style_transfer, load_image, save_image

# Load your content and style images
content_img = load_image('path_to_your_content.jpg')
style_img = load_image('path_to_your_style.jpg')

# Perform style transfer
output_img = style_transfer(content_img, style_img)

# Save the resulting image
save_image(output_img, 'path_to_save_stylized_image.jpg')
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs` folder. Explore various functions and classes to understand the internals of the style transfer process.
